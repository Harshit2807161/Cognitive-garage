# AI-Powered Sustainability Advisor using Bayesian Networks

## Project Overview

This project aims to architect an AI-powered Sustainability Advisor that **would help companies** enhance their decision-making regarding sustainability initiatives. By leveraging **Bayesian Networks** to assess **Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG)** factors, the system would provide recommendations on **Carbon Market investment strategies** that help companies achieve their **net-zero carbon emission goals**.

Through the integration of advanced AI and **Bayesian Modelling**, the solution would enable dynamic risk assessment and forecasting, ensuring companies can make well-informed sustainability decisions that contribute to the global climate agenda.

## Problem Statement

Many companies struggle to align their operations with the sustainability goals laid out in the **Paris Agreement**. Achieving **net-zero emissions** often requires navigating complex regulatory frameworks and making strategic investments in carbon markets. However, the uncertainty and risks associated with these markets present a significant challenge. This project addresses this challenge by using **Bayesian Networks** to evaluate ESG factors and provide **recommendations** for carbon market investments that maximize sustainability impact.

## Key Features

- **Bayesian Networks for Risk Assessment**: Probabilistic models to assess risks and uncertainties in carbon market investments and ESG factors.
- **Delphi Method for Consensus Building**: A structured, multi-round Delphi method gathers expert opinions on ESG impacts and investment strategies, ensuring informed decision-making.
- **Data-Driven Recommendations**: The system analyzes historical data, economic, environmental, and social impacts to recommend investment strategies.
- **Carbon Credit Analysis**: Assesses the quality of carbon credits and offsets based on environmental and economic criteria.
- **Dynamic ESG Impact Analysis**: Quantifies the **social**, **economic**, and **environmental** impacts of recommended strategies on corporate sustainability goals.

## Bayesian Modelling for Total Impact Calculation

The **Bayesian Networks** developed for this project would help companies understand how their investments and sustainability efforts impact three critical dimensions: **Social Impact**, **Economic Impact**, and **Environmental Impact**. By breaking down the total impact into these distinct yet interconnected domains, companies can better assess the multi-dimensional effects of their sustainability strategies.

### Social Impact Network
This network models how various factors such as employee well-being, workplace safety, and business ethics would contribute to a company's social standing. Key variables include:
- **Employee Practice**: Workforce inclusion, ethics, and transparency.
- **Workplace Safety**: Accidents, casualties, and safety improvements.
- **Business Ethics**: Corporate transparency and ethical governance.

### Economic Impact Network
This network focuses on factors like profitability, credit health, and operational costs, helping companies understand how their sustainability efforts could influence their financial performance. Key variables include:
- **Financial Health**: Profitability, credit strength, and financial development.
- **Market Competitiveness**: Competitor analysis and market share.
- **Cost Feasibility**: Labor, operation, and supply chain costs.

### Environmental Impact Network
The environmental network would help companies calculate the environmental implications of their actions, particularly in terms of resource management and pollution. Key variables include:
- **Resource Management**: Efficiency in energy use, water management, and material use.
- **Pollution and Emission**: CO2 levels, green innovation, and environmental competence.

*Description*: This diagram represents the Bayesian Network used to calculate the **total impact** by integrating **social**, **economic**, and **environmental** factors.

## Methodology

**Mapping Input Parameters and Decision-Making Process**

The first step in constructing the Bayesian Networks involves mapping out input parameters and the decision-making process. This includes identifying key variables that influence the sustainability of a company and determining the relationships between these variables.

- **Mathematical Models**: Techniques such as regression analysis, decision theory, and optimization methods were used to map the relationships between variables.
- **Decision Tree Structure**: The decision-making process is represented as a decision tree, where input parameters are linked to sustainability outcomes. By simulating scenarios and quantifying the impacts of different sustainability strategies, companies can arrive at practices that are economically, socially, and environmentally optimal.
  
### Bayesian Networks and Decision Modelling

A **Bayesian Network** is a probabilistic graphical model used to represent uncertain domains. In this project, Bayesian Networks model how different variables (e.g., carbon credits, operational efficiency, and market risk) interact to influence sustainability outcomes. The goal is to compute **P(Cause | Evidence)**, or the posterior conditional probability of achieving a certain outcome given observed data.

1. **Define Variables**: Identify critical variables for social, economic, and environmental impact.
2. **Dependencies**: Map out relationships between variables based on historical data and expert input.
3. **Conditional Probabilities**: Assign conditional probabilities to each variable, defining the likelihood of specific outcomes.
4. **Inference**: Use the network to perform inference, predicting outcomes, assessing risks, and providing recommendations for investment strategies.

### NoisyOR Operator
For certain risk factors, we used a **NoisyOR Operator** to simplify the conditional probability table. This was particularly useful when modeling complex relationships like system failures or the likelihood of environmental degradation due to multiple independent factors.

## Results

The system **would help companies** increase their sustainability efforts by offering targeted, data-driven recommendations. It enables companies to:
- **Optimize Carbon Market Investments**: Invest in high-quality carbon credits that not only meet regulatory standards but also maximize environmental impact.
- **Improve ESG Assessment**: The Bayesian network model would help companies perform a more accurate analysis of ESG factors, allowing for more reliable long-term planning.
- **Achieve Net-Zero Emissions**: Companies using the model can align their sustainability strategies with net-zero targets by investing in high-quality offsets and sustainable practices.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the potential of AI and **Bayesian Modelling** for enhancing corporate decision-making in sustainability. By combining expert consensus through the **Delphi Method** and probabilistic inference with **Bayesian Networks**, this AI-powered system **would help companies** navigate the uncertainties in carbon markets and make informed decisions that align with their net-zero goals.
